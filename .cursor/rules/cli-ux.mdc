# CLI UX & Rendering Rules

## Visuals
- **Styles**: Use `charmbracelet/lipgloss` for all colors and padding.
- **Tables**: Use `olekukonko/tablewriter` for lists.
- **Markdown**: Use `charmbracelet/glamour` for rendering task descriptions.

## Cross-Platform UI
- Do not use symbols that are known to break in standard Windows CMD (stick to basic UTF-8 or provide fallbacks).
- Errors MUST be written to `os.Stderr` and styled in Red.
- Success messages should be styled in Green.

## Command Structure
- All commands are built using `spf13/cobra`.
- Every command must have a `.Short` and `.Long` description.
- Use `PersistentFlags` for global configuration like `--project` or `--format`.
